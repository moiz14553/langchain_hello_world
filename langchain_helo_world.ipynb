            "* **Reasoning:** The ability to draw inferences, make logical deductions, and understand relationships between concepts.\n",
            "* **Perception:** The ability to interpret sensory input from the world, such as images, sounds, and text.\n",
            "* **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The ability to understand and generate human language.\n",
            "* **Planning:** The ability to set goals, devise strategies, and execute plans.\n",
            "* **Adaptation:** The ability to adjust to changing circumstances and learn from new experiences.\n",
